## Usage

```jsx
import { FarcasterEmbed } from "react-farcaster-embed";
import "react-farcaster-embed/dist/styles.css"; // include default styles or write your own


// use warpcast url
<FarcasterEmbed url="https://warpcast.com/pugson/0x4294c797" />

// or username and hash of the cast
<FarcasterEmbed username="dwr" hash="0x48d47343" />

## Styling

The embed will inherit your body color by default when you import the default stylesheet.

You can change the color of the component by changing its parent's color or adding custom CSS:

```css
.farcaster-embed-container {
  color: purple;
}
```
